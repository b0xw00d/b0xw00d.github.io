<p>I&rsquo;ve been given guidelines on how to write this post.  I was told to choose the values that have been present when I&rsquo;ve been  happiest in my life. The importance of these values is immeasurable to me.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth of the matter is, I haven&rsquo;t spent a whole lot of time being happy.  I&rsquo;ve dealt with some pretty terrible depression and I&rsquo;ve fallen short on these values more often than I care to admit.  I constantly feel like I&rsquo;m falling short, letting my ego drive my actions, letting all the people around me down; life is hard and I suck at it sometimes.</p>

<p>Compassion and positive leadership have always helped.  That&rsquo;s why I was drawn to this program, but sometimes I don&rsquo;t know if I deserve to be here.  I feel like an impostor.  I&rsquo;m totally insecure and every day it&rsquo;s a struggle not to fall into negativity and old habits.  I think about giving up sometimes but I won&rsquo;t let myself.</p>

<p>We lost a cohort-mate last week.  He was a bright guy and I worry he might have lost control because of me.  He and I probably have  more in common than anyone knows, and watching someone else struggle like that in the midst of this program; well, I&rsquo;m not dealing with it well.  I tried so hard to get this person to work with me because I saw something in him that I see in myself.  I feel like I pushed too hard to make this person open up and be positive and he just wasn&rsquo;t ready.  Reflecting on it, I can&rsquo;t help but see the way in which my ego drove my behavior and probably made me seem self-righteous.  We were asked to be vulnerable in this setting, and I recognize now that he completely laid himself bare.  I respect this more than you can know.</p>

<p>A huge reason why I chose DBC is because I want to learn how better to handle my emotions in tough situations like this.  Who&rsquo;s to say he wasn&rsquo;t trying to do the same?  I hope the next time I encounter someone in a similar situation I can give them the space they need.  Most of all I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t show more compassion.  I fell short on this one and it&rsquo;s going to take me awhile to get over it.  At this point, I just have to keep my head down and move on.  I know that much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to have you all in my life.  I&rsquo;ve already learned so much from you guys and I truly hope I can reciprocate and pass on what little wisdom I have in the future.</p>

<p>I want to build beautiful and meaningful things, but beautiful, meaningful, relationships are what&rsquo;s most important.  That&rsquo;s the real lesson.  We lost a cohort-mate last week.  It seems like it should be a priority that we not lose another.  We all have our own reasons for choosing DBC and we should all feel safe and supported in our decisions.  I know if I lost this opportunity, I would be devastated.</p>
