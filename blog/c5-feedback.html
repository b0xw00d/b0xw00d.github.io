        <i>Identify one emotion that arose during a pairing session</i>
        I've had a ton of fun pairing thus far!  All of my pair partners have been very respectful and helpful with the exception of one.  I feel very lucky to have all these awesome new friends!

        <i>Describe kind, actionable, and specific feedback</i>
        Kind, actionable, and specific feedback is an essential part of the pairing progress.  I feel that all the feedback I got was KAS thus far.  There was one person who thought it would be hilarious to act like an angsty teenager about the whole thing.  I mostly just laughed and felt sorry for him.  At first I was very understanding and compassionate to this person because they seemed like they were only 17 years old.  After doing some snooping I found that he started college in 2004.  Yikes.  I guess some people never grow up.

        <i>Discuss the feeling of vulnerability when pairing and reading feedback</i>
        I always feel vulnerable.  I think it's a part of being an honest person.  There's always this idea that people know exactly who and what you are and could use it against you at any time.  Pairing is no different.  The only experience I have writing code is a C++ course I took at UIC in 2012 so I'm pretty insecure about my skills as a programmer.  Also, I'm definitely not the type to pretend that I'm good at something when I'm not.  Like I stated above: everyone has been totally kind in their feedback.  Vulnerability is always a part of stuff like this.  I just do my best to not let it control me.
