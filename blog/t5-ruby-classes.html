        <i>Explain when, why, and how to use classes</i></br>
        I would use classes whenever there was a real world object that needed to be represented through my code.  I would generally break classes into the brodest terms possible.  For instance, a class named Vehicle seems more appropriate than a class name 2014 Honda Civic.  More specific instances like a 2014 Honda Civic should be created with either methods or vairables.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Explain how data structures and classes can model a real-world object</i>
        I would compare ruby classes to cookbooks, with ruby methods being the recipes.  For instance, you can have a class called BBQ and within it you could create several methods that make BBQ dishes.  Ribs, brisket, sausage links, cornbread.  These could all be methods in the class BBQ.  Later you could even split cornbread into a different class called Sides if you wanted to.  Classes are extremely helpful in Ruby precisely because they make it so easy to model real world objects in a digital environment.
