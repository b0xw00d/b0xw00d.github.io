      This week at DBC we started the section on Ruby!  A lot of this week's material was review for me but I still learned a bunch and I definitely sharpened my skills a bit in the process.  I'm going to write this blog about hashes and arrays.  Hopefully some of you find it useful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start by describing arrays.  An array is a list of elements that are grouped together and presented in an ordered list.  Every element in an array is representative of a single object.  These can be strings, numbers, variables -- any object.  The Array class in ruby come with a ton of predefined methods which can be called on arrays to manipulate these elements.  Arrays are extremely useful for sorting and arranging large amounts of data quickly.
    <p>
      Arrays are created just like any other variable except that they accept a list of elements contained by brackets like so: my_array = [2,22,222];.  As I stated earlier, there are plenty of other ways to initialize and define an array.  I won't get into all of them here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for hashes.  Hashes are very similar to arrays with one major difference and some smaller ones as well.  In an array every element corresponds to one specific value -- not the case for hashes.  Every elment in a hash is a key-value pair.  Meaning you can have a with 10 different keys name "dog" that all hold a different value; names of dogs, breeds, dogs in the family, etc.  This is especially useful for sorting and organizing information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes, like arrays, have plenty of ways of being intitialized.  I'll show you the syntax which, in my opinion, is easiest to read here: pets = {"dog": "rat terrier", "dog": "shiba inu", "cat": "himalayan"};.  Here, the hash named pets has two "keys" -- dog and cat.  The values paired with these keys are different breeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see how organizing information in this way can be especially useful when coding web apps.  The use of both arrays and hashes allows the programmer a ton of felxibility and organization.  Warning: this can get really confusing, realy fast, and there is a ton to learn about both of these Classes in Ruby.  I've barely scratched the surface here but I hope this has served as a useful primer on the subject.  Thanks for taking the time to read this!
