      Hello, everybody!  I'm just finishing up week 3 at Dev Bootcamp and I thought I'd share some of my thoughts here.  I'll be writing about my struggles, areas of confidence, learning/thinking styles and some of the social relationships I've formed over the past 3 weeks.  Let's get started!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before entering phase 0 at DBC I was asked to take a personal thinking quiz to identify my Gregorc thinking style.  The Gregorc lumps people into 4 different thinking stlyes: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random.  I was identified as Concrete Random.  This means I enjoy experimenting, taking risks, and using intuition to solve problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the benefits of being a Concrete Sequential thinker?  There are plenty.  Concrete Sequential thinkers respond well to trial-and-error approaches.  We love to tinker with things!  This has proved especially useful in the design portion of phase 0.  Tinkering with HTML and CSS was a big part of week 2 for me and I really enjoyed myself for most of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      What's difficult about being a Concrete Random thinker?  Keeping detailed records.  This is an area where I've always struggled.  I've always taken a very "organic" approach to problem solving.  I like to dive straight in without hesitation and when I'm feeling my "flow," it will usually take a force of nature to stop me from working.  This is a tremendous asset in certain situations, but a horrible handicap in others.  When things need to stay perfectly organized and by-the-book, I struggle sometimes.  The best way for me to stay on top of this is to set up accountability meetings with my peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past 3 weeks I've had to be sure to constantly interact with other people in my cohort.  This forces me to stay organized and on topic for the sake of my peers.  Otherwise, I'm just a rabbit in a hole and nothing is gonna bring me back to the surface.  Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've all heard it a million times before: software engineering is a team sport.  This has become increasingly clear to me over my time at DBC.  If I allow myself to become reclusive and totally independent I'll get lost in the chaos of my though process.  Learning to work with others and keep myseld organized for their benefit will be my greatest challenge to come.
    </p>

      Thanks for taking the time to read this!
