Asking good questions is important.  This is a blog post about how I try to do just that!

<!--more-->

I usually try to ask questions that have specific answers that I need.  I try to keep my questions concise enough to be answered directly but long enough to be clear what's being asked.  I try to think of all the specific places I ran into trouble then reflect on each one in a sentence or two.  If they are separate questions, then I split them up.  Seems pretty straight forward to me.  I always say please and thank you and I never make the person answering the question do more work than is absolutely necessary.  It really just comes down to awareness.  I try no to waste people's time.
