This is going to be a short blog post because I honestly don't have much to say at this moment.  I'll probably add more later.  Anyway, I created a new site with Octopress and you're looking at it right now.  The whole process was relatively painless.

The reason I kept this one short is because I did this weeks ago and I honestly can't remember what I struggled with anymore.  I should have documented everything as I was going but you live and you learn, I suppose.
