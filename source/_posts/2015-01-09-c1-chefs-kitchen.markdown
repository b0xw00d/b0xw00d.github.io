There is no doubt in my mind that anyone can teach themselves how to use Rails.  Human beings are amazing creatures.  Time and time again they will surprise you with how much knowledge they can actually cram into those tiny little skulls of theirs!  That being said: a true craftsman goes beyond just these technical skills.

A true craftsman knows her customers, peers, apprentices and mentors from the inside out, and she strives to strengthen these relationships whenever possible.  Dev Bootcamp puts strong emphasis on these principles, and plans to fortify them in us, through the fire of a 9 week bootcamp environment.  I couldn't be happier to have this opportunity in front of me.

I know the people I'm about to go on this journey with have a lot to teach me.  I hope that, in time, I can take that knowledge and pass it on to others.  This is looking like it's going to be the raddest thing I've ever done!  I'm stoked, to say the least; but I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't nervous.

There's an awesome quote that I stumbled upon in Dave Hoover's book, "Apprenticeship Patterns" (this book is full of awesome quotes!): "Working on real problems for real people is what hones the craft, not just doing it for self-satisfaction." - Ken Auer

I look forward to meeting you all in person one day.  Hopefully I'll have as much to teach to you, as I do to learn from you.  Thanks for taking the time to read this!
